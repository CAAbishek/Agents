# 🤖 AI Agents Framework – Multi-Agent Task Automation

A modular multi-agent AI system designed to simulate human-like coordination between multiple intelligent agents such as a planner, executor, and evaluator.

## 🔍 Overview
This project showcases collaboration between AI agents that break down, execute, and validate tasks using LLMs (Large Language Models). Each agent is designed with a focused responsibility and they communicate to complete tasks autonomously.

## 🚀 Features
- Agent-based task planning and execution  
- LLM-driven decision making and context understanding  
- Scalable architecture for various workflows  
- Modular design for adding/removing agents

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- LangChain  
- OpenAI GPT  
- Custom Agent Protocols (Planner, Executor, Evaluator)

## ⚙️ Applications
- Customer support automation  
- Process workflows in businesses  
- Personal productivity and scheduling agents  
- Educational tutoring systems
